# Git-project
 This is a version-control system that mimics some of the basic features of the popular system Git. The project is based on project 2 of the [Berkeley CS61B](https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2/proj2) course. I implemented the `Main`, `Repository`, `Commit`, `Branches`, `Blob`. The functions in the Utils class and the python testing suit is provided by the course.
# Commands
Compiling the program with: 
 javac gitlet/*.java
Running various git command with:
 java gitlet.Main [command]
The gitlet supports `init`, `add`, `commit`, `rm`, `log`, `global-log`, `find`, `status`, `checkout`, `branch`, `rm-branch`, `reset`, `merge`.
