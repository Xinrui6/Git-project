# Git-project
 This is a version-control system that mimics some of the basic features of the popular system Git. The project is based on projct 2 of the Berkeley CS61B course. I implemented the Main, Repository, Commit, Branches, Blob. The functions in the Utils class and the python testing suit is provided by the course.
